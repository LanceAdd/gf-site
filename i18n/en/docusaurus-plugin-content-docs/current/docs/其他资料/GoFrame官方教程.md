The following four learning methods are officially recommended:

- Buy a `Golang` related book to systematically learn the basics, for example: "The Go Programming Language" or "[Microsoft's Go Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/learn/paths/go-first-steps/)".
- Go through the `GoFrame` official documentation, which has been refined over several years and is continually updated.
- Examine the `GoFrame` framework's source code. Since it is designed modularly, you can study each module one by one and think about why it is implemented this way.
- Finally, you can ask other friends in the `QQ` group and WeChat group, discuss and learn from each other, but be mindful of the skill of asking questions, otherwise, you might feel lonely in a lively group.

Additionally, you can keep an eye on the `gf` main repository of `GoFrame` and the current website documentation project updates to stay ahead in project developments.
