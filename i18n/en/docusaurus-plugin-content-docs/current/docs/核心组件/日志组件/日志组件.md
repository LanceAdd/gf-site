description: "glog is a core log management module of the GoFrame framework, offering high-performance log management features. It supports file output, log levels, log categories, and rich debugging and call trace features. Create a custom Logger object through glog.New or use default methods to print logs. The notable features of the glog component include simplicity, support for color printing, asynchronous output, chain operations, and custom log handling."

`glog` is a universal high-performance log management module that implements powerful and easy-to-use log management features, making it one of the core components of the `GoFrame` development framework.

## Basic Introduction

**Usage:**

```go
import "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/glog"
```

**API Documentation:**

[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/glog](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/glog)

**Brief Explanation:**

1. The `glog` module uses a fixed log file name format as `*.log`, always using `.log` as the log file extension.
2. `glog` supports file output, log levels, log categories, debug management, call tracing, chain operations, rolling segmentation, and other rich features.
3. You can use the `glog.New` method to create a `glog.Logger` object for custom log printing, but it is recommended to use the default package methods provided by `glog` for printing logs.
4. When using package methods to modify module configuration, note that any `glog.Set*` setting methods will be **globally effective**.
5. The default time format for log content is `Time [Level] Content Newline`, where `Time` is accurate to milliseconds, `Level` is optional output, `Content` is the input of the calling party, and `Newline` is optional output (some methods automatically add newline symbols to the log content). Example log content: `2018-10-10 12:00:01.568 [ERRO] An error occurred`.
6. `Print*/Debug*/Info*` methods output log content to standard output (`stdout`); to prevent log disorder, `Notice*/Warning*/Error*/Critical*/Panic*/Fatal*` methods also output log content to standard output (`stdout`).
7. The `Panic*` method will trigger a `panic` error after outputting log information.
8. The `Fatal*` method will stop the process and return the process exit code as `1` (the normal program exit status code is `0`) after outputting log information.

## Component Features

The `glog` component has the following notable features:

- Easy to use, powerful features
- Support for configuration management, using a unified configuration component
- Support for log levels
- Support for color printing
- Support for chain operations
- Support for specifying output log files/directories
- Support for link tracking
- Support for asynchronous output
- Support for stack printing
- Support for debugging information switching
- Support for custom `Writer` output interfaces
- Support for custom log `Handler` processing
- Support for custom log `CtxKeys` keys
- Support for `JSON` format printing
- Support for `Flags` features
- Support for `Rotate` roll segmentation feature

## Singleton Object

The log component supports the singleton mode, using `g.Log(单例名称)` to get different singleton log management objects. The purpose of providing singleton objects is to use different configurational log management objects for different business scenarios. We recommend using the `g.Log()` method to get the singleton object for log operations. This method will automatically read the configuration file and initialize the singleton object, and this initialization will only be executed once.

## Difference between `glog.Print` and `g.Log().Print`

- `glog` is the package name of the log component, `g.Log()` is a singleton log component object.
- The `g.Log()` singleton object is maintained by the object management component `g` package, and it automatically reads the log configuration during initialization, making it easy to use. It is recommended for most scenarios to use the log component in this way.
- `glog` is used in the form of an independent component, and by default, it will directly output logs to the terminal. You can also set global configuration through configuration management methods or create independent log objects using `New`.

:::tip
**User**: Why are there two ways to print logs? Which one should I use?

**Answer**:

Because each component of the framework is **designed with decoupling** and the framework **can be used as a standalone tool library**. For instance, if a project only needs the logging component, then methods from the `glog` package can be used directly without introducing other components. However, in project engineering usage, the use of tool libraries tends to be cumbersome, often involving configuration and component initialization (which can lead to secondary encapsulation in most scenarios). Therefore, the framework also provides a **coupling package** called the `g` package, which loads some common components by default. `g.Log()` is one of these logging components. It will automatically read and initialize configuration objects based on engineering specifications, quickly initialize logging objects, and implement singleton management, greatly simplifying log usage in engineering.
