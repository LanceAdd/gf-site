description: "Prepare the environment for microservice development, primarily including the dependency installation guide for the GRPC protocol and the CLI tool for the GoFrame framework. Learners need to ensure the installation of GRPC-related tools and master the basic application of the GRPC protocol in microservice development using the GoFrame framework."

In the following microservice chapters, the `GRPC` protocol will be the main focus, introducing the development, components, and tool usage of microservices.

## Dependency Installation

Before further learning, please first understand the concepts related to `GRPC` and install the corresponding tools in the local development environment:

- [https://grpc.io/](https://grpc.io/)
- [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/)

For `MacOS` environments, you may consider using the `brew` tool to install dependencies:

```
brew install grpc protoc-gen-go protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

After completing the installation of the dependency tools, refer to the section of [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) to learn the basic usage of the `protoc` tool.

## Framework Tools

Ensure the `GoFrame` framework CLI development tool is version `>= v2.4`. For tool installation and upgrades, refer to the section: [Development Tools](../开发工具/开发工具.md)

For the `GRPC` protocol, framework tools provide additional command support, greatly simplifying microservice development based on the `GRPC` protocol.
