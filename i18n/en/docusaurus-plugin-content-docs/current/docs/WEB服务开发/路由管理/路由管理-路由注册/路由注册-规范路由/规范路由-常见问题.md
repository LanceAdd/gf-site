description: "How to support multiple HTTP Method submissions for the same interface under the strict routing of the GoFrame framework. When designing RESTful interfaces, each API should correspond to a specific HTTP Method, such as creating a user or retrieving a user list, etc. If multiple HTTP Methods need to be supported for an interface, it can be set through Meta tags. Additionally, learn how to use type aliasing to return array forms for the Data field in the Response structure."

## How to support multiple `HTTP Method` submissions for the same interface under strict routing

First, an interface should only perform one function. `HTTP Method` is meaningful (for example, in `RESTful` interface design). An interface supporting multiple `HTTP Method` types is usually a sign of poor interface design, and it's recommended to review the interface design.

Generally, there is no scenario where an `API` needs to be associated with multiple `HTTP Methods`. For example, for user interfaces, a `CRUD` interface in RESTful implementation should have `4-5` API definitions, each implementing different business logic. Therefore, there might be the following API definitions for a `RESTful` interface:

```
Interface Name    Method    Path
Create User       PUT       /user
User List         GET       /user
User Details      GET       /user/{uid}
Modify User       POST      /user/{uid}
Delete User       DELETE    /user/{uid}
```

If indeed there is a scenario where an interface needs to support multiple `HTTP Methods`, it can be done by using a comma `,` to separate each `HTTP Method` in the `method` attribute of the `Meta` tag, for example:

```go
type SaveReq struct {
    g.Meta `path:"/user/{uid}" method:"put,post" summary:"Save User" tags:"User Management"`
    Uid    int64  `dc:"User ID"`
    Name   string `dc:"Username"`
    // ...
}
```

## How to make the `Data` field return only as an array without a named key-value pair using the default provided `Response` structure

This can be achieved by using type aliasing.
