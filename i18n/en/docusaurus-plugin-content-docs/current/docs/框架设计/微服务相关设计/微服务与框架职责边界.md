description: "Discusses the responsibility boundaries of the GoFrame framework in supporting microservice project development. The content covers basic components, development tools, interface protocol adaptation, and how interface design achieves the frameworkâ€™s extensibility to meet the needs of different data services and communication protocols."

The support of the code framework for microservice projects is realized through **basic components, development specifications, and development tools**.

The framework supports microservice project development, but as a code development framework, it has its responsibility boundaries. Microservice-related content not involved in the code framework includes:

- CICD
- Service Governance
- Monitoring and Alerts
- Specific technical solutions, such as service layering, service decomposition, log collection, distributed locks, distributed caching, distributed transactions, etc.
- Data service selection, such as which message queue service to choose, should be decided based on specific business scenarios.

In the diagram below, the green parts are microservice-related components, while the other parts are already implemented basic components, development tools. All components of the framework adopt interface design to ensure good extensibility.

#### **Interface Protocols**

Microservices do not restrict the communication protocol between services. For example, most are primarily HTTP, and in the Golang development language stack, most are primarily gRPC.

#### **Interface Adaptation**

Regardless of the communication protocol adopted by the upper layer, the framework provides interface adaptation-related components and tools to shield the differences in interface protocols, converting various protocols entering the framework into the internal interface format. The adaptation for different upper-layer interface protocols is implemented in the form of tools (code generation), and no changes to the framework's internal business interfaces and business logic code are required. At the same time, since the upper-layer interface protocols are converted into internal interface formats, the framework can provide a unified interface delivery document for different protocols.

#### **Service Components**

The framework provides commonly used core basic components related to microservices. The service components are designed with an interface in the main library to ensure lightness and decoupled design of the main library, with specific implementation logic provided through community components.

#### **Core Components**

The core components of the framework are the lowest-level project components, used to construct upper-layer service components or business components.

#### Data Services

At the bottom layer of the service are often various data services such as MySQL, MongoDB for data storage, or Kafka, RocketMQ for message queues.
