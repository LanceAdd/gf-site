## Feature Improvements

The minimum dependent `Golang` version of the framework has been upgraded from `v1.15` to `v1.18`.

1. `g`
    1. Added `g.Go` method for conveniently creating asynchronous `goroutine` with `ctx` and `recover` parameters.
2. `glog`
    1. Improved the `Handler` callback processing function's `HandlerInput` input parameter by adding a `Values` parameter, which is the input parameter list for log printing: [Log Component-Handler](../docs/Core Component/Log Component/Log Component-Handler.md)
    2. Added a `HandlerStructure` general component method to print log content as structured parameters: [Log Component-Handler](../docs/Core Component/Log Component/Log Component-Handler.md)
    3. Improved the `rotate` logic of log files to fix the issue where files could not `rotate` in some scenarios.
3. `gerror`
    1. Added error stack modes (`brief/detail`): In `brief` mode, the error stack only prints non-framework component stacks. In `detail` mode, the error stack prints the complete framework code call chain. The framework defaults to `brief` mode: [Error Handling-Other Features](../docs/Core Component/Error Handling/Error Handling-Other Features.md)
4. `gcode`
    1. Added `gcode.CodeInternalPanic` error code. All `panic` errors captured by framework components will return this error code.
5. `gmap`
    1. Added a `Diff` method for comparing and returning the differences between two `Map`.
6. `gaes`
    1. Added `PKCS7Padding/PKCS7UnPadding` methods.
7. `gdb`
    1. Removed `ConvertDataForRecord` conversion method and added `ConvertValueForField` conversion method.
    2. Changed the `CheckLocalTypeForField` method to change the return parameter type from `string` to `LocalType`.
    3. These are primarily used for database implementation and are typically used in community components. Users implementing the `gdb.DB` interface locally need to note these changes.
    4. Added `Model.Partition` method allowing users to explicitly specify partition parameters during database operations.
    5. Added `Model.LeftJoinOnFields/RightJoinOnFields/InnerJoinOnFields` methods for more convenient implementation of `Join` operations.
    6. Fixed the issue with the `Model.WherePrefixNotIn` method implementation.
8. `gredis`
    1. Added `Cluster` configuration item for specifying whether to use cluster mode: [Redis-Configuration Management](../docs/Component List/NoSQL Redis/Redis-Configuration Management.md)
    2. Added `Protocol` configuration item to specify `RESP` version: [Redis-Configuration Management](../docs/Component List/NoSQL Redis/Redis-Configuration Management.md)
9. `gi18n`
    1. Improved translation file reading logic to support automatic file reading from the resource manager: [I18N-Internationalization-Configuration Management](../docs/Core Component/I18N-Internationalization/I18N-Internationalization-Configuration Management.md)
10. `gclient`
    1. Added `NoUrlEncode` feature to prevent `GET` requests from automatically performing `UrlEncode` encoding on parameters.
11. `ghttp`
    1. Improved exit signal handling to support graceful exit after exit signal capture on the `Windows` platform.
12. `goai`
    1. Supports automatic recognition of `ghttp.UploadFile` type as `File` type in `OpenAPIv3`.
    2. Removed duplicate description on `Path` object and `Method` object.
    3. Automatically convert interface example field types to corresponding data types based on parameter data types.
13. `gcfg`
    1. Added `AdapterContent` configuration interface implementation to use specific configuration content for implementing configuration management objects: [Configuration Management-AdapterContent](../docs/Core Component/Configuration Management/Configuration Management-Interface Design/Configuration Management-AdapterContent.md)
14. `gctx`
    1. Added `NeverDone` method to wrap the given `ctx` object and return a `ctx` object that never expires or gets `Cancel`.
15. `gfile`
    1. Default file creation mode changed from `0777` to `0755`.
    2. Improved `Copy/CopyFile/CopyDir` methods by adding `CopyOption` optional parameter to control copy logic options.
16. `gmutex`
    1. Improved `gmutex.Mutex` object by using the new version of `mutex` in `Golang`, directly using the new version of the standard library's `TryLock/TryRLock` and no longer implementing these repetitive methods. Retained `LockFunc/TryLockFunc` methods.
    2. Added `gmutex.RWMutex` object, extending the `sync.RWMutex` object from the standard library, adding `LockFunc/TryLockFunc, RLockFunc/TryRLockFunc` methods.
17. `gstr`
    1. Added `List2/ListAndTrim2/List3/ListAndTrim3` methods implementing features similar to `PHP list`, splitting strings into multiple result values.
    2. Added `CaseConvert` method for performing string naming format conversion based on the given `CaseType` type parameter.
18. `gconv`
    1. Added `ConvertWithRefer` method to use the given parameter as a type reference and convert the given parameter to the specified parameter type.
19. `gutil`
    1. Added `FillStructWithDefault` method to automatically fill the given `struct` object/pointer by reading default values through `struct tag`.
20. `gvalid`
    1. Fixed the issue where the `enums` validation rule did not support `map` parameter types.

## Community Components

### Configuration Management

1. Added `contrib/config/consul` component for the `consul` service implementation of the configuration management component interface: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/config/consul](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/config/consul)

### Database Implementation

1. Improved `contrib/drivers/dm` component:
1. Support `schema` parameter configuration.
2. Support `time.Time/*time.Time` time type parameter operations.
2. Improved `contrib/drivers/sqlite` component, supporting `Insert Ignore` and `Save` operations.
3. Added `contrib/drivers/sqlitecgo` component to support `i386` system architecture via `cgo`.
4. Improved `contrib/nosql/redis` component:
1. Added `TLSConfig` configuration to support `TLS` connection to `Redis Server`.
2. Added `Protocol` configuration item to support the latest version of `Redis Server`.

### Service Registration Discovery

1. Added `contrib/registry/nacos` component using `nacos` for microservice registration discovery: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/registry/nacos](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/registry/nacos)
2. Improved `contrib/registry/file` component to automatically delete expired registration items, preventing the client from discovering and connecting to expired server addresses.
3. Fixed some implementation issues in the `contrib/registry/polaris` component.

### Microservice Components

1. Improved `contrib/rpc/grpcx` component:
1. Clients support directly specifying connection addresses to access the server.
2. Enhanced unit testing to improve code quality.

## Development Tools

1. Improved `cli` tool installation method by adding support for `go install`: `go install github.com/gogf/gf/cmd/gf/v2@latest`
2. Improved the `gf run` command by adding `WatchPaths/-w` configuration to support specifying a list of monitored paths, avoiding the `too many opened files` issue caused by monitoring all project files locally: [Automatic Compilation-run](../docs/Development Tools/Automatic Compilation-run.md)
3. Improved `gf gen ctrl` command by adding a `Merge/-m` option to control generated controller code files according to the `api` layer instead of splitting them into separate implementation files based on `api` interfaces: [Interface Specification-gen ctrl](../docs/Development Tools/Code Generation-gen/Interface Specification-gen ctrl.md)
4. Improved `gf gen dao` command by adding `RemoveFieldPrefix/-rf` option to automatically remove the name prefix for generated table fields: [Data Specification-gen dao](../docs/Development Tools/Code Generation-gen/Data Specification-gen dao.md)
5. Improved `gf gen pbentity` command by adding `RemoveFieldPrefix/-rf` option to automatically remove the name prefix for generated table fields: [Data Table PB-gen pbentity](../docs/Development Tools/Code Generation-gen/Data Table PB-gen pbentity.md)
6. Improved `gf gen service` command to automatically recognize method comments in `logic` module objects and generate them into `service` interface files.
7. Enhanced `gf version/gf -v` command with more detailed tool version, runtime environment, and framework version information.
8. Improved initialization efficiency of development tools by removing `init` package method logic that affects initialization efficiency.
9. Fixed the issue where `Link` database configuration specified in the `gf gen dao` command was invalid.
10. Other minor fixes.
