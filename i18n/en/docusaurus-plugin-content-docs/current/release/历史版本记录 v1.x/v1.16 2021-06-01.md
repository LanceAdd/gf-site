   4. Added **dozens** of ORM model operation methods (referencing `PHP Laravel`), recommended for users currently using `goframe` to take a look:
      1. [ORM Chain Operations (ðŸ”¥HighlightsðŸ”¥)](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-chain-operations/orm-chain-operations.md)
      2. [ORM Chain Operations - Write and Save](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-chain-operations/orm-chain-operations-write-and-save.md)
      3. [ORM Chain Operations - Update and Delete](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-chain-operations/orm-chain-operations-update-and-delete.md)
      4. [ORM Chain Operations - Data Query](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-chain-operations/orm-chain-operations-data-query/orm-chain-operations-data-query.md)

## Feature Improvements

1. `ORM`
   1. Added full link context `Context` parameter transmission: [ORM Context Variables](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-context-variables.md). In link tracing, `SQL` and database connection information (excluding sensitive configuration) are recorded by default. Component link tracing information can be configured to be disabled.
   2. Further improved `ORM` component log records, logs are only effective in debug mode. For details, refer to the section: [ORM Advanced Features](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-advanced-features/orm-advanced-features.md)
   3. Added dozens of `ORM` model operation methods (referencing `PHP Laravel`), for example: `InsertAndGetId`, `Min/Max/Avg/Sum`, `Increment/Decrement`, `WhereBetween/WhereLike/WhereIn/WhereNull`, `OrderAsc/OrderDesc/OrderRandom`, etc. It is recommended for those using `goframe` to take a look. For details, refer to the sections:
      1. [ORM Chain Operations (ðŸ”¥HighlightsðŸ”¥)](../../docs/core-components/database-orm/orm-chain-operations/orm-chain-operations.md)

## Development Toolchain

The `CLI` tool has been updated primarily to simplify `dao` model code generation, remove duplicate method generation, and remove directly returning model object methods. The `dao` object is changed to directly inherit the `Model` object from the `GoFrame ORM` component for querying data through the given model, hence some method usage will need adjustments.
