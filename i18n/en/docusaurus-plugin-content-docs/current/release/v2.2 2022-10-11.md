description: "GoFrame framework v2.2.0 version released, refactoring the validation component and improving the database component interface design, supporting Dameng database, and adding multiple configuration center implementations. Thanks to the support of over 44 code contributors, the GoFrame framework becomes more powerful and flexible."
---

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, friends! The `GoFrame` framework `v2.2.0` version is officially released today!

The main highlights of this version are:

- Refactoring and improving the validation component most frequently used by developers, allowing community developers to easily develop and maintain built-in validation rules. Some commonly used validation rules have been expanded, making the component's built-in rules more robust and powerful.
- Reconstructed the design of the database component interface, enabling community developers to more easily add a new type of database `driver`. Currently, the framework provides implementations for `9` types of database `drivers` through community components, meeting the needs of most business projects. Particularly, this version adds support for the domestic Dameng database. In the future, we hope community developers can provide more `driver` implementations for domestic databases and contribute them to the open-source community.
- Richness of community components, with this release mainly adding `3` types of configuration center interface implementations, supporting `Apollo/Polaris/Kubernetes ConfigMap.` The `GoFrame` framework adopts a modular, low-coupling design, with components divided into the core library and community components. The core library provides core, general, lightweight basic components, while community components are decoupled, standalone component packages, enhancing the framework's capabilities while ensuring the core library remains lightweight and universal.
- The version's code contributors exceed `44`, with a total of `107` contributors to the framework. Thank you all for your efforts and contributions to the community! ðŸ’–
