description: "Retrieve request parameters submitted by the client in a Web Server using the GoFrame framework, focusing on handling parameters submitted via HTTP methods like Query String, Form, and Body using the r.Get method. Learn how to handle default parameter values and automatic parameter type recognition. Detailed example code demonstrates receiving and processing parameters in GoFrame, and analyzes common issues, laying the foundation for structured processing of parameter objects in later sections."

In previous sections, we learned how to develop a simple `Web Server` program. In this section, we will attempt to retrieve the parameter information submitted by the client in the `Web Server`. To simplify the example, we use the `Query String` method to pass request parameters.

## Parameter Example

We will make a simple modification to the previous `Hello World` example program:

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
)

func main() {
    s := g.Server()
    s.BindHandler("/", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
        r.Response.Writef(
            "Hello %s! Your Age is %d",
            r.Get("name", "unknown").String(),
            r.Get("age").Int(),
        )
    })
    s.SetPort(8000)
    s.Run()
}
```
In the `GoFrame` framework, retrieving parameters is very convenient. In this example, we use the `r.Get` method to retrieve parameters submitted by the client. This method can retrieve parameters submitted by all `HTTP Methods`, such as `Query String/Form/Body`, etc. Internally, it automatically recognizes and parses the type submitted by the client, supporting formats like `json/xml`. The method is defined as follows:

```go
func (r *Request) Get(key string, def ...interface{}) *gvar.Var
```
As you can see, the `Get` method accepts two arguments, the first being the parameter name, and the second an optional argument which signifies the default value. The return result is a `*gvar.Var` object, which is a runtime generic object provided by the `GoFrame` framework. Developers can convert parameters to various types as needed for their business scenarios.

## Execution Result

After running, we visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/?name=john&age=18 and can see the page output meets expectations.

We visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and can see the page output also meets expectations. When the `name` parameter is not passed, the program will use the default value `unknown`, and the `age` parameter will use the default `int` type value `0`.

## Learning Summary

In this section, we learned how to retrieve parameters submitted by the client in an HTTP callback function.

However, as you can see, there are some obvious issues in the example code:
- The parameter reception uses hard-coded parameter names, which, in real project development, can easily lead to exceptions due to spelling errors.
- Hard-coded parameter names cannot determine business meaning and data types, making it difficult for long-term management and maintenance, such as describing parameters, basic operations like type validation, etc.

In the next section, we will try to avoid this problem by using structured parameter objects.
