description: "Quickly understand the development process and features of the Web Server API by viewing the Documents sections to resolve any doubts. GoFrame is a low-coupling, modular design framework with independent module designs, and independently written documentation. The community provides introductory video tutorials, and later a complete business project will be developed using the GoFrame framework project scaffold."

## Learning Summary
Through the quick sections, you should have understood the complete development process of the `Web Server` API and mastered some practical features. In these sections, we only touched on them briefly; for more detailed explanations and introductions to functional features, please refer to the corresponding Documents sections. When you feel confused about the use of a particular module, it is recommended to carefully read the corresponding Documents sections, which provide detailed explanations of the important functional features, usage methods, and common issues of each component.

:::info
If you start browsing the Documents, it should be noted that since `GoFrame` is a low-coupling, modular design, each module is relatively independent. Therefore, the documentation in the Documents is also written based on modularity, with each chapter introducing only the usage of the corresponding component itself.

What should we do next?

## Project Scaffold

In the upcoming sections, we will attempt to use the project scaffold provided by the `GoFrame` framework to develop a simple and relatively complete business project.
