Hello everyone, welcome to the quick start chapter of the `GoFrame` framework! Because `GoFrame` is a modular, low coupling design development framework that includes common basic components and development tools, it can be used either as a complete business project framework or as an independent component library.

In this chapter, we start from downloading, installing, and using the framework to guiding you in completing a relatively complete `Web Server` API development.

:::info
If you are not ready for the `Go` language development environment, it is recommended that you first refer to the environment installation documentation: [Environment Preparation](../../docs/å…¶ä»–èµ„æ–™/å‡†å¤‡å·¥ä½œ/å‡†å¤‡å·¥ä½œ.md) to understand some basic `Go` language knowledge before proceeding to the next step.

If you encounter any problems in any chapter of the quick start, feel free to leave a comment ðŸ’¬, and we will try our best to provide you with an answer as soon as possible ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ.

## Limitations

To ensure the stability and security of the framework, the minimum required base version of the `Go` language for the `GoFrame` framework is usually 1 to 3 versions lower than the latest `Go` language version.

Minimum `Go` version required by the current latest framework version:
```bash
golang version >= 1.20
```

## Installation
You can install the latest version of the framework in the following way:
```bash
go get -u -v github.com/gogf/gf/v2
```

Typically, include and use the latest version of `GoFrame` in the project's `go.mod`:

```bash
require github.com/gogf/gf/v2 latest
```

## Running

Let's try running the following code:
```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello GF:", gf.VERSION)
}
```
This simple code example prints the currently introduced `GoFrame` framework version. Execute it with the following command:
```bash
go run main.go
```
You will see in the terminal:
```bash
Hello GF: v2.7.4
```

Congratulations! This means you have successfully referenced `GoFrame` in the current project.

Next, we will use `GoFrame` to develop a simple `HTTP Server` service.
