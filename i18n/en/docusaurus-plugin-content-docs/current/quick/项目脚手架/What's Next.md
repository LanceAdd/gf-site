## Simple Summary

Alright, after you have studied the basic chapters, you should have learned the following content:

1. Business project setup
2. Project startup logic
3. Understanding the overall framework design approach
4. Writing a simple `api` project

## Upcoming Study

What's the next step in further learning about the framework?

### Community Tutorials

Teachers from the `GoFrame` community have shared some great learning materials. Interested students can explore more 🚀: [Community Tutorials](../../course/社区教程.md)

### Further Study of Service Components

Most students learn the framework to better develop their business projects, which are mainly based on two types: Web projects or microservices.

#### Web Project Study

If it's an `HTTP WEB` project, please proceed to this chapter for study: [WEB Service Development](../../docs/WEB服务开发/WEB服务开发.md)

This chapter will progressively introduce the development of WEB services and the use of related components.

#### Microservice Study

If it's a microservice project, please proceed to this chapter for study: [Microservice Development](../../docs/微服务开发/微服务开发.md)

This chapter primarily introduces how to use the framework to develop microservices.

### Further Study of Framework Components

If you encounter a component you're not familiar with during development and study, you can first read the source code or check the corresponding component introduction chapter on the official website. Additionally, some students may use the framework as a basic component library, so you can also individually check the introduction chapter for each component.

#### Core Components

Core components are an indispensable part of the framework; most business projects will use them. They are a key focus for learning the framework. Chapter link: [Core Components (🔥Important🔥)](../../docs/核心组件/核心组件.md)

#### Component List

The component list presents a summary chapter of all the components of the framework. Chapter link: [Component List](../../docs/组件列表/组件列表.md)

## Important Tips

Learning the framework through examples is much more effective. The framework provides a wealth of example projects:
