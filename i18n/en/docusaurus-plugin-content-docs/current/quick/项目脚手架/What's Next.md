## 简单总结

好的，当您已经学习完前面的基础章节后，你应该学习到以下的内容：

1. Business project setup
2. Project startup logic
3. Understand the overall design concept of the framework
4. Write a simple `api` project

## 接下来的学习

那么接下来，我们应该怎么进一步学习框架内容呢？

### 社区教程

The teachers in the `GoFrame` community have shared some great learning materials for everyone. Interested students can further explore 🚀：[社区教程](../../course/社区教程.md)

### 服务组件的进一步学习

Most students learn the framework to better develop their own business projects, which are based on two types: Web projects or microservices.

#### Web项目学习

If it is an `HTTP WEB` project, please enter this section to learn: [WEB服务开发](../../docs/WEB服务开发/WEB服务开发.md)

Starting from this section, it will introduce the development of WEB services and the use of related components step by step.

#### 微服务学习

If it is a microservice project, please enter this section to learn: [微服务开发](../../docs/微服务开发/微服务开发.md)

This section mainly introduces how to use the framework for microservice development.

### 框架组件的进一步学习

If you encounter a component that is not quite usable during development and learning, you can first read the source code or check the corresponding component introduction section on the official website. In addition, some students use the framework as a basic component library, and they can also view the description and usage section of the corresponding components individually.

#### 核心组件

Core components are an indispensable part of the framework, which are basically used in business projects and are a focus of framework learning. Section address: [核心组件(🔥重点🔥)](../../docs/核心组件/核心组件.md)

#### 组件列表

The component list summarizes all the components of the framework in one section. Section address: [组件列表](../../docs/组件列表/组件列表.md)

## 重要的Tips

Learning the framework through examples is much more effective, and the framework provides a wealth of example projects:

- `Web API` development: [https://github.com/gogf/gf-demo-user](https://github.com/gogf/gf-demo-user)
- `Web MVC` development: [https://github.com/gogf/gf-demo-chat](https://github.com/gogf/gf-demo-chat)
- Microservice development: [https://github.com/gogf/gf-demo-grpc](https://github.com/gogf/gf-demo-grpc)
