description: "Use the GoFrame framework's scaffold to build a simple and complete business project. The content covers important steps such as the installation and verification of framework tools, creating a project template, running the project template, and how to upgrade the framework version. The project template default supports HTTP Web Server and provides API documentation display and Swagger page viewing features."

Starting from this chapter, we mainly focus on a complete business project to introduce how to use the framework-provided scaffold to complete a simple API project.

:::warning
**Before proceeding further, please be aware** that since `GoFrame` is a truly enterprise-level, engineered development framework for `Golang`, it is designed meticulously, easy to use, and well-documented with an active community. **Once you learn and master the use of the framework, you will find it hard to return to the past manual development era**.

If you encounter any problems in any chapter of the quick start, feel free to leave a comment in the comment section üí¨, and we will try our best to provide you with timely solutions üåüüåü.

## Install Framework Tools

The development tools provided by the framework offer convenient development commands to simplify development work, providing practical commands such as project scaffolding, code auto-generation, tool and framework updates, etc. Tool download address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases](https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases)

### Precompiled Installation

Precompiled installation refers to the binary files precompiled by the open-source community for developers to use directly. The binary files are hosted on the `github` repository.

#### `Mac` Environment

```bash
wget -O gf "https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases/latest/download/gf_$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)" && chmod +x gf && ./gf install -y && rm ./gf
```

You may encounter the following common issues:

- If the current system does not have the `wget` command installed, please continue executing the command after using `brew install wget` to install it.
- üî• If you are using the `zsh` terminal, there might be `gf` alias conflicts (`git fetch` shortcut command), then please **restart the terminal software** to continue using it after the installation (at least execute it once).
- Your `Golang` development environment is not ready, lacking the `GOOS` or `GOARCH` environment variable. It is recommended to first refer to the environment installation documentation: [Environment Installation](../../docs/Other Resources/Preparation/Preparation.md).
- If other issues that cannot be resolved arise, you can use the subsequent „ÄêSource Code Compilation Installation„Äë method.

#### `Linux` Environment

```bash
wget -O gf "https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases/latest/download/gf_$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)" && chmod +x gf && ./gf install -y && rm ./gf
```

If the system does not have the `wget` command installed:

- `Ubuntu/Debian` systems should use `apt-get install wget -y`
- `CentOS/RedHat` systems should use `yum install wget -y`


#### `Windows` Environment

Manually download the corresponding binary file and double-click to install following the terminal instructions. If double-click installation fails, please adopt the ultimate „ÄêSource Code Compilation Installation„Äë method.

### Source Code Compilation Installation

Install into the system directory after downloading the source code locally to compile binary files, using the `go install` command, which is the universal installation method:

```bash
go install github.com/gogf/gf/cmd/gf/v2@latest
```

### Verify Successful Installation

Execute the `gf -v` command. If it can output the following information, it indicates that you have successfully installed the framework scaffold tool üëç

```html
$ gf -v
v2.7.4
Welcome to GoFrame!
Env Detail:
  Go Version: go1.23.1 darwin/arm64
  GF Version(go.mod): cannot find go.mod
CLI Detail:
  Installed At: /Users/john/go/bin/gf
  Built Go Version: go1.23.1
  Built GF Version: v2.7.4
Others Detail:
  Docs: https://goframe.org
  Now : 2024-10-29T13:30:30+08:00
```

Note that the `Go/GF Version` is the `Golang` and `GoFrame` framework version used by the currently compiled binary file, and the `GoFrame Version` is the `GoFrame` framework version used by the current project (auto-detect the `go.mod` in the current directory).

:::info
Common Issue Precautions: üî• If you are using the `zsh` terminal, there might be `gf` alias conflicts (`git fetch` shortcut command), then please **restart the terminal software** to continue using it after the installation (at least execute it once).

## Create Project Template

```bash
gf init demo -u
```

This command creates a project scaffold directory, with the project name being `demo`. The `-u` parameter specifies whether to update the `goframe` framework used in the project to the latest version. The `GoFrame` framework has a unique project engineering structure. For a detailed introduction to the project directory structure, please refer to: [Project Directory Design](../../docs/Framework Design/Engineering Development Design/Project Directory Design.md).

The framework's scaffold directory is designed with general applicability, meeting the needs of WEB, terminal, microservices, etc. business development scenarios. By default, it generates an `HTTP Web Server` template project. After understanding the complete directory meaning, if there are any directories you don't need, you can delete them yourself.

## Run Project Template

The project template can be run with the following command:

```bash
cd demo && gf run main.go
```

Where `gf run` is the dynamic compilation command of the framework development tool, and it can be replaced with the `go run` command.

After execution, the terminal outputs:

```text
$ cd demo && gf run main.go
build: main.go
go build -o ./main  main.go
./main
build running pid: 76159

```

By default, the project will set the web service port to `8000`, enable `OpenAPI` API documentation, and display `Swagger` API documentation pages. These key pieces of information will be displayed in the terminal. By default, all route information will be printed to the terminal, and this project template will only add one demonstration route: `/hello`.

Default Route: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello](http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello)

## Upgrade Framework Version

You can always run the following command in the root directory of the project (where `go.mod` is located) to update to the latest framework version:

```bash
gf up -a
```


## Learning Summary

Through this chapter, we learned how to download and install the scaffold's `cli` tool and create a scaffold project template using this tool.

In the next chapter, we will briefly introduce the project startup process of this scaffold project template.
